        <p>In Graphite, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms</p>
        <p>Thus, it has a giant covalent hexagonal structure in hexagonal layers,
          <br />one valence electron per carbon atom is delocalised within the structure;
          <br />these electrons are free to move to carry charges to conduct electricity
          <br />causing it to be a good conductor of electricity, and a good choice as
          <br />an anode material

        <h1>As you can see...</h1>
        <p>In Silicon Carbide, one silicon atom and a carbon atom form 4 covalent bonds</p>
        <p>Thus, it has a giant covalent tetrahedral structure, with each silicon and
          <br />carbon atom having strong intermolecular forces of attraction, thus
          <br />conducting electricity well, something that is needed in a battery.
          <br />However unlike graphite, it can be considered a semiconductor as
          <br />due to its energy levels in its valence shells, it does not conduct
          <br />electricty as well due to being unable to transfer charges as fast.
