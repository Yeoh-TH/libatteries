        <h1>As you can see...</h1>
        <p>In Graphite, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms</p>
        <p>Thus, it has a giant covalent hexagonal structure in hexagonal layers,
          <br />one valence electron per carbon atom is delocalised within the structure;
          <br />these electrons are free to move to carry charges to conduct electricity
          <br />causing it to be a good conductor of electricity, and a good choice as
          <br />an anode material.
        </p>
        <p>Along with that, graphite is also not soluble in water, as it is a giant
          <br />covalent hexagonal structure, thus it remains in a solid state in the battery
          <br />and is not required to be in aqeuous form to conduct electricity, as a result
          <br />being lighter and easier to carry around in portable batteries with a lower
          <br />density.
        </p>
        <h1>Why does this matter?</h1>
        <p>
          Using Silicon carbide and graphite in batteries aligns with the UNSDG goal 12
          <br />of Responsible consumption and production through reducing the need for
          <br />precious resource mining. Utilizing these carbon compounds will keep
          <br />the battery at the same efficiency as per normal but use more affordable
          <br />and abundant resources. By reducing mining activities, environmental impacts
          <br />will be reduced as well.
        </p>
        <p>Using silicon carbide and graphite also aligns with the principle of the 12
          <br />Principles of Green Chemistry of “Prevention” and “Energy efficiency”.
          <br />Through the use of these carbon compounds, less energy would be required to
          <br />manufacture these batteries as less mining activities would be required,
          <br />directly correlating to the prevention of environmental destruction
          <br />and waste generated by mining activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          These materials are crucial for Singapore's Green Plan 2030 as they pave the way
          <br />for more efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions. ⁤⁤By using batteries
          <br />with Silicon Carbide and graphite, we can store renewable energy from sources like
          <br />solar and wind power, helping to stabilize the grid and reduce our dependence on
          <br />fossil fuels. ⁤⁤These battery technologies also support the rise of transportation,
          <br />a key aspect of Singapore's efforts to cut down carbon emissions and tackle climate
          <br />change. So, SiC and graphite in batteries are in line with the objectives of the
          <br />Green Plan 2030, promoting clean energy adoption and enhancing energy efficiency
          <br />in Singapore.

        <h1>As you can see...</h1>
        <p>In Silicon Carbide, one silicon atom and a carbon atom form 4 covalent bonds</p>
        <p>Thus, it has a giant covalent tetrahedral structure, with each silicon and
          <br />carbon atom having strong intermolecular forces of attraction, thus
          <br />conducting electricity well, something that is needed in a battery.
          <br />However unlike graphite, it can be considered a semiconductor as
          <br />due to its energy levels in its valence shells, it does not conduct
          <br />electricty as well due to being unable to transfer charges as fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Silicon Carbide being a giant covalent tetrahedral structure
          <br />thus this is because there are strong covalent bonds between a
          <br />silicon atom and four other other carbon atoms bonded in a
          <br />tetrahedron manner, thus alot of energy is required to
          <br />overcome the forces of attraction, giving it its strength,
          <br />which is useful in a battery.
          <br />This gives the cathode material a high tensile strength and
          <br />withstand being compressed, making the battery safer to use.
        </p>
        <h1>Why do we want a semiconductor?</h1>
        <p>
          This is because in a battery, we would like to be able to control and
          <br />limit the amount of charges in the amount of electrons flowing
          <br />through the terminal and control the current being supplied
          <br />to the compoenents which the battery is provding charge to
          <br />and avoid overloading and burning.
